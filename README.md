Sentiment Analysis and Music Recommendations Systems
Description: a review-based recommendation system with natural language processing (NLP) and Collaborative Filtering on 1.5M review data and 75k music meta data, utilizing Python via keras framework on an AWS EC2 instance.

●	Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Sentiment Analysis on the review texts classifying the reviews as positive and negative, summarized keyword using NLTK, visualized word embeddings, and gained 91.4% test accuracy.
●	Trained a stacked Autoencoder with SGD on tokenized and embedded text matrix for dimensionality reduction.
●	Trained a Deep Neural Network with regularization for the recommender with MAE below 0.4 and MSE below 40.
●	Explored the data with multiple visualizations and PCA and composed and presented a research report with 22 pages.
